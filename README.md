# Procedural-Terrain-Test
This project is based on, and started, by Following through with the Procedural Terrain Tutorial by Sebastian Lague [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&amp;list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3&amp;index=1)

## Preview
In the endless terrain scene, I have set up 2 objects, the preview, which will hide on gameplay, and the endless terrain  object.
For the preview, you can choose to display as a height map, or a 3d mesh.

## Land Generation
The height map used for the mesh generation is created by multiple passes of perlin noise at finer and finder detail.
This noise generation has sliders to effect the permenance, lacunarity, and total number of passes.
